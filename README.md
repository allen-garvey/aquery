# aQuery

Lightweight, stripped-down version of jQuery. Shares the same interface, so you should freely be able to substitute one for the other, as long as you only require the functionality provided by aQuery.

## Dependencies

* Compatible with IE10 or later - requires `document.querySelectorAll` and `element.classList`
* npm / gulp to create custom build

## Caveats

* hide/show will delete any inline display styles you have added and show simply sets element to display block
